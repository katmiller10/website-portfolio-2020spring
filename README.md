So my website is basically breaking down pop music in terms of the classic songs from the early 2000s, the current pop music, and pop music in the future. I still have a lot of work to do because three out of my four pages all follow the same format and layout, but I feel like this is a pretty good start and enough for it to be peer reviewed. I definitly want to change the way my images are lined up, but I'm having a pretty hard time figuring out how to format it correctly. More updates to come.

Update for the class activity today. All my files are in my website folder and here is the link to my website.

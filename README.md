So my website is basically breaking down pop music in terms of the classic songs from the early 2000s, the current pop music, and pop music in the future. I still have a lot of work to do because three out of my four pages all follow the same format and layout, but I feel like this is a pretty good start and enough for it to be peer reviewed. I definitly want to change the way my images are lined up, but I'm having a pretty hard time figuring out how to format it correctly. More updates to come.

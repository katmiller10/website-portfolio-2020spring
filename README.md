I decided to create a website about something I am interested and quite passionate about: Pop Music. My website is basically a break down of pop music in terms of the classic songs from the early 2000s, the current pop music, and pop music in the future. I also included an About Me page at the end that links to a form where people can send me their comments after viewing my website. The link is listed below, I hope you enjoy!

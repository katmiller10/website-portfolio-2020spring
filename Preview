So this is an extremely rough preview of my website. I’ve had a hard time compiling something that is pretty substantial given that I am cramming for midterms and that I know so little about coding and building a website. I’m really planning on getting a substantial amount of work done over spring break after I have more time to get more affiliated and comfortable with some of the exercises on the tutorial. Right now I have set up a basic template for how I want my website to look like. I’m going to have a big header with the title being “The World of Standoms”. I’m then going to have subcategories for each different tier of Standom. I have the legendary, iconic, and then up and coming tiers. When you click on one of the subcategories you will be redirected to another page that include more information for the following artists. On these pages is where I want to include a lot of text body and pictures. I kind of feel like I am getting a bit over my head because I really don’t know if I will be able to do any or all of this, but I’m optimistic that it will work out in the end. I also have chosen a bright pink color for my lettering and borders. I want to use bright blue, green, and yellow colors as well. I also want to play around with the font and use a more curvy and playful font because my website is not very serious or sophisticated. Overall, I feel like I have a lot of big ideas and I know what I want my website to look like, but it is going to take me a lot of trial and error to get what I am envisioning.
